# SwitchTracker
Tracks the stocks of mechanical switches from various vendors. With limited supplies with mechanical switches for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, it may be useful to have a way to keep track of which switches are in stock and which are not. This is a full-stack application. The frontend is coded in react javascript while the RESTful backend is implemented using java in Spring Boot.
