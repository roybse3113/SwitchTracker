# SwitchTracker
Tracks the stocks of mechanical switches from various vendors. With limited supplies with mechanical switches for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, it may be useful to have a way to keep track of which switches are in stock and which are not. This is a full-stack application. The frontend is implemented with react javascript while the RESTful backend is implemented using java in Spring Boot.


The RESTful backend implemented in java through Spring Boot served to access the fields needed for each switch. This includes the price, the name, and whether it is in stock or not.
